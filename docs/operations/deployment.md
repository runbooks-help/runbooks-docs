## Storage

- **Runbooks** are plain markdown read from a content **source** at runtime; not stored in a database, and not part of a backup of it. By default that is a local directory (`CONTENT_DIR`, default `content`); set `CONTENT_SOURCE=git` to read from a repository instead, cloned into `CONTENT_GIT_CACHE` (records under `GITSYNC_BASE_PATH` are skipped). The image ships an empty directory (it never bundles content); mount yours there, or point the source wherever you like.
- **Identity** (users, passkeys, sessions, invites, audit events) lives in the configured database. SQLite is the default and keeps everything in one file at `file:./data/runbooks.db`.
- In the container the working directory is `/app`, so the SQLite file is `/app/data/runbooks.db`. Mount a volume at `/app/data` to persist it.
- The schema is applied at startup from embedded, idempotent migrations. There is no external migration tool and no migration step: **to upgrade, replace the binary or image and restart.**
- `IDENTITY_PUBLIC_URL` is effectively immutable once passkeys exist: changing the host invalidates every credential.

## Content

Runbooks are read from a **source**, selected by `CONTENT_SOURCE`:

- `local` (default): read `CONTENT_DIR` directly. Mount your content there.
- `git`: clone `CONTENT_GIT_REPO` (branch `CONTENT_GIT_BRANCH`) into `CONTENT_GIT_CACHE` and read `CONTENT_GIT_PATH` inside it. Content sits at the repo root; a `GITSYNC_BASE_PATH` directory in the tree is skipped by the content walk.

### SSH credentials

SSH remotes authenticate with the **ambient SSH agent** by default: with no `CONTENT_GIT_SSH_KEY` and no `CONTENT_GIT_TOKEN`, `go-git` connects through `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, so a running `ssh-agent`, 1Password, or equivalent is enough on a workstation; there is nothing to configure. Host keys are verified against `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`, then `~/.ssh/known_hosts` / `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`; there is no `accept-new`, so the host must already be known.

A **deployment or CI job has no agent**, so supply the key explicitly. Mount the private key and a `known_hosts` file read-only, then point the variables at them:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e CONTENT_GIT_REPO=git@github.com:org/content.git \
  -e CONTENT_GIT_SSH_KEY=/run/secrets/gitsync_key \
  -e SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS=/run/secrets/known_hosts \
  -v /host/gitsync_key:/run/secrets/gitsync_key:ro \
  -v /host/known_hosts:/run/secrets/known_hosts:ro \
  ghcr.io/runbooks-help/runbooks:<tag>
```

The key is read as a file path, not a value, so an orchestrator secret mounted as a file works directly. HTTPS remotes need `CONTENT_GIT_TOKEN` instead and no agent.

### Startup order

- **Cache present:** the cached checkout is parsed and served immediately, then the remote is fetched in the background. An unreachable remote does not delay or fail boot; the last successful fetch keeps serving.
- **No cache:** the clone happens before the server listens. Boot fails only when there is neither a cache nor a successful fetch.

A failed fetch or a parse error keeps the current in-memory snapshot (last-good); it never serves a half-loaded set.

### Refreshing content

`POST /api/content/v1/refresh` fetches the source, parses it and swaps the snapshot atomically, so no request observes a partially-loaded set and in-flight requests keep the set they started on.

- With identity on it is **admin-only**: a signed-in admin; an API key is read-only by construction and cannot call it.
- With identity off it requires `Authorization: Bearer $CONTENT_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and is disabled (`403`) when no token is configured.

A local source is re-read in place; only a git source fetches.

Set `CONTENT_REFRESH_INTERVAL` (e.g. `5m`) to refresh on a timer instead of relying on an external scheduler. It is opt-in and requires at least `1m`; each wait is jittered ±10% so several instances polling one repo do not beat in lockstep. Refreshes are serialized (a tick that lands while a refresh is already running is skipped, and the manual endpoint waits its turn), and a failed refresh only logs and keeps the last-good snapshot. There is no webhook.

### Cache

`CONTENT_GIT_CACHE` (default `data/content`) is a single inspectable directory under the data volume, and is an ordinary git clone. It is not a backed-up artifact: a restart with the remote reachable re-fetches, and an empty cache just means a fresh clone at boot.

## Backing up SQLite

Identity lives in the configured database (SQLite by default) and can be backed up while the app runs.

<!-- steps -->

## Take a snapshot

`VACUUM INTO` writes a consistent, self-contained copy:

```bash
sqlite3 ./data/runbooks.db "VACUUM INTO '/backup/runbooks-$(date +%F).db'"
```

## Restore it

Stop the app, point `IDENTITY_DB_DSN` at the copy, and restart:

```bash
IDENTITY_DB_DSN=file:/backup/runbooks-2026-10-04.db ./runbooks
```

A plain file copy of `data/runbooks.db` is equally valid with the app stopped. Verified once against this procedure: create a database, `VACUUM INTO` a copy, open the copy and read a row back; the snapshot restores cleanly.

<!-- sections -->

## MySQL and PostgreSQL

Use the database's own tooling: `mysqldump` / `pg_dump`, or the managed service's snapshots. Runbooks ships no backup code. The identity tables are:

```
users, credentials, sessions, invites, webauthn_challenges, auth_events
```

There are no foreign keys, so the set is self-contained; restoring the database restores identity. Runbook content is unaffected by a database restore.

## Health and readiness

`GET /healthz` returns `200 ok`, unauthenticated, on an identity-on instance too: wire container or load-balancer probes to it.

## Version

`runbooks --version` prints the build stamp: `runbooks vX.Y.Z` for a tagged build, the short commit otherwise. Tagged images also carry `org.opencontainers.image.version` and `…revision` labels:

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{index .Config.Labels "org.opencontainers.image.version"}}' \
  ghcr.io/runbooks-help/runbooks:<tag>
```
